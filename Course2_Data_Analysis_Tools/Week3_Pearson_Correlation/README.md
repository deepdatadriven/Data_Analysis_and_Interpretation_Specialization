This session shows you how to test hypotheses in the context of a Pearson Correlation (when you have two quantitative variables). Your task will be to write a program that manages any additional variables you may need and runs and interprets a correlation coefficient. Note that if your research question only includes categorical variables, you can choose other variables from your data set just to get some practice with the tool.
